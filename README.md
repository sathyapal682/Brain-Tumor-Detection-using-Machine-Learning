# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

# Requirements
Python
Libraries: sklearn, openCV, numpy, matplotlib 

# Detail Description about Project
In brain tumor classification using machine learning, we built a binary classifier to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. We built our classifier using transfer learning and obtained an accuracy of 96.5% and visualized our model's overall performance.<br>
